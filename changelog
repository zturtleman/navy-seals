* Houston, we have a problem:
	the player hit box is not only used for hit-detection, but also for
	hit-detection with walls. lowering it to fix the headshotzone will break
	the hit-detection with the world (players are able to 'look' through walls.
	what to do now? we definitly have to fix the hitboxes :|
	Actually we would have to switch to hitboxes everytime, we make a trace to
	see if a weapon hits a player. Meaning go through all entities, if it's a 
	player entity, fix hitboxes, make the trace, unfix hitboxes.
	It's a hack, but at the moment the only possible solution in my mind
* Houston, problem solved
* patched g_weapons.c g_seals.h g_seals.c

	put NS_FixHitboxes in front of the trace and NS_RestoreHitboxes after the

	new default settings which should be included into the pak
* patched game/variables.h
	tweaked recoil settings of all weapons (smg's where snipers almost)
* patched game/g_weapons.c
	bug with shotguns removed (crouching made the spread lower)

2004/01/29a:
* patched cgame/cg_ents.c
	reenabled floating of the bomb
* patched cgame/cg_weapons.c CG_Mwheel_f / CG_Weapon_f
	fixed weapon selection

2004/01/27a:
* patched game/g_seals.c
	enabled debugging of locational damage
	fixed number of grenades
* patched ../ui/ingame_char.menu
	40mm grenades are now called Smoke grenades
* patched cgame/cg_ents.c
	removed the flare under the bomb
	removed the floating of the bomb

2004/01/26a:
* patched cgame/cg_playerstate.c
	patched CheckLocalSounds as there could be a bug when joining
	unpure servers. Seemed to be a q3 bug with variable initialization
	which one has to workaround.
* patched game/g_weapons.c Apply_Weapon_Kick
	added some parts of defconXs weaponhandling 
* patched game/variables.h
	tweaking weapon settings now. Needs new testing however
* patched cgame/cg_ents.c
	the flare that gets spawned when someone drops the bomb will now
	be floating OVER the bomb and not at (0,0,0).
* patched several files to find weaponchangebug
	cgame/cg_event.c -> line 521
	cgame/cg_newDraw.c -> line 1699
	cgame/cg_playerstate.c -> line 342

* patched game/g_cmds.c
	added floodprotection for say / say_team / say_target / say_radio
* patched cgame/cg_events.c
	removed debugmessage
* patched game/variables.h
		patched the scope mod for snipers. Sniper should ne be too accurate
		when walking and scoping. Here are my calculations:
		Sniper is crouching still and scoping: delfection angle of 0.02
		meaning a deflection of 10cm at about 287m (pretty accurate)
		Sniper is strafe-walking through a building: deflection angle
		of 0.08 meaning a deflection of 10cm at about 72m (you will
		miss the head!)

2004/01/24b:
* patched game/g_seals.c
	fixed number of grenades (no grenades actually needs a -1 lol)
* patched game/g_cmds.c / G_SayTo
	Spectators cannot say anything public anymore (at least i hope that)

2004/01/24a:
* patched cgame/cg_main.c / cgame/cg_local.h / cgame/cg_events.c
	added 4 differend sound effects for flashbang which depend on the
	time beeing flashed
* patched ui/ui_main.c
	added menu background music
* patched game/variables.h
	tweaked the flashbang a lil bit
	flashed from behind only has 40% of blindtime now
	flashbang fade is to 3 seconds now
	flashbang time is to 8 seconds now
	To conclude: 
	  5 seconds maximum blind 100% if standing in front
	    of a flashbang and looking into it
	  0.2 seconds maximum blind 100% if standing in front
	    of a flashbang and not looking into it
* patched almost all files in cgame
	decoupled flashbang blindtime from deaftime. if you don't look into
	the flashbang and are not really blinded, you still can be very deaf.

	slightly increased recoil when running
	tweaked weapons a lil bit

2004/01/22g:
* patched game/variables.h
	increased recoil
* patched game/g_weapons.c
	removed a bug in Apply_Weapon_Kick
		somehow the variables in bytecode won't be initialized new 
		and therefore a variable in a function will keep it's value
		over several function calls

2004/01/22c:
* patched game/g_seal_menu.c
	removed the drop weapon bug
* patched game/g_seals.c

2004/01/21a/b:
* patched game/variables.h
	tweaked weapon settings
* patched cgame/cg_playerstate.c
	removed buffer overflow in CheckLocalSounds

2004/01/20c:
* patched game/variables.h
	tweaked weapon settings
* patched ui/ui_main.c ui/ui_local.h cgame/cg_consolecmds.c
	removed delayed xp distribution code (as it was bugged sometimes).
	Now it works however, but could produce lags sometimes. 
	Anyhow, I have to rewrite the whole UI for the next feature release.
	The whole UIs should be reworked to have a better look, better
	functionality and depend only on CLIENTSIDE data (!!!!)
	Big Bad Example:
		* client connected to server with ping 140
		* every click on a button implies a send new data to server and
			fetch the actual data from server
		* this implies 140 + s + 140 = 280 + s milliseconds delay (for
			s really small hopefully)
		* this means only 4 clicks per second are recognized!!!!!!
	How to make it better:
		* everything in the menu should depend only on clientside code
		* after hitting ACCEPT, all is sent to server
		* the reply will be there withing one second (if 500 ping)

	removed the updatecharacter code in all those files
	reworked the xp distribution code. resetxp in consolecmds now sets a
	ui_character cvar which is also used in ui_main.c when recalculating the

* patched nsco/game/g_missile.c G_RunMissile
	nades do not bounce from ceiling any more, but can bounce at virtual walls

	removed bunker hack
	removed sleepingwolf mapfix

2004/01/10:
* patched nsco/cgame/cg_weapons.c / CG_Tracer
	put the tracer to begin 1 meter in front of the attacker
* patched nsco/game/g_missile.c / fire_grenade / flashbang / smokenade
	made as Democritus said the range of a nade more depandent from the
	strength. there is now a base range for throwing and rolling a nade. to this
	baserange there will be added strength/10*base_range*range_factor. the 
	range_factor is defined in nsco/game/variables.h and is defaulted to 0.5
* patched nsco/game/g_cmds.c / ClientCommand
	removed the 'funny' console commands insulting players.
* patched nsco/cgame/cg_players.c/ CG_ResetPlayerEntity
	This function is called everytime a player gets near anotherplayer to reset 
	the graphical data. due to the sounddesign of nsco (the sound will only
	be played if the client is near), this routine produced the
	soundbug (as a sound was played when the routine was executed).
	Fix: set the client in charge to interpolate and set the next predictable
	event (mostly an OLD event) to already be processed.
	Anyhow, this is a HAX-fix because the code seems to be from an old point
	release and i just hacked around the problem in charge (that not all sounds
	are transmitted to the client ...)

2004/01/09:
* fixed dates in changelog :lol:
* patched nsco/game/g_missile.c nsco/cgame/cg_event.c
	the BANG effect from the flashbang is now played regardless if it's behind
	or in front of the player. The FLASH effect is calculated in cg_event.c
	and therefore i added a new variable in nsco/game/variables.h
	indicating the factor to multiply the FLASH effect durating with if the
	flashbang went off behind the player.
* fixed assaultfieldbug (probably)
	patched nsco/game/g_gameentities.c assault_field_stop and
	assault_field_think
	perhaps the fix in assault_field_stop was lil bit too much
* added debug output
	must remove debug output from nsco/game/g_combat.c and
	nsco/game/g_gameentities before release. the output in g_combat.c
	is for debugging the nades. You can die if the nade just inflices 2 
	damage to you if it's inflicting to your head. If so, it's not a nadebug,
	it's a feature in weapons-code i must remove.
	The output in g_gameentities are the debug message from Defcon-X
	redirected to all client screens. I want to see if the assaultfield bug
	still exists and if so, those messages should give me a clue.
* removed debug output
	see above for details
* assaultfieldbug
	should be resolved now. only had to change assault_field_stop in
	nsco/game/g_gameentities.c
* removed VIP crash bug
	actually it was no bug, it was a feature ^^
	in game/g_seals.c was the initialization routine for VIP gameplay. If no
	VIP could be spawned, the server reported an error bringing the game-server
	down. So if the whole VIP team did teamkills and noone is allowed to play,
	the server reported an error forcing the gameserver to shut down. Therefore
	i changed the behaviour to:
	If there is no VIP, the opposing team wins.
* patched game version to 1.9a
	must be done in game/bg_public.h AND cgame/cg_info.c

2004/01/08:
* fixed flashbang code in nsco/cgame/cg* files
	there is now a variable called is_flashed which is defined in
	nsco/cgame/cg_draw.c. This variable is indicating if and only if
	the player is 100% flashed (meaning he doesn't see anything at all).
	This variable is used in several files to block the execution
	of ALL KNOWN trap_S_StartSound in cgame. So there will be no nonlocal
	sound played when beeing flashed
* patched nsco/game/variables.h
	added a variable concerning flashbangs and documented variables
* patched nsco/compile.sh
	now the script got 5 options:
	cgame: will only recompile cgame and repack it
	game:  will only recompile game and repack it
	ui:    will only recompile ui and repack it
	pack:  will only repack everything
	all:   is the default in will recompile everything
	by default after every option the generated pak6.pk3 is installed to
	${HOME}/.q3a/seals-testing
* patched nsco/game/g_combat.c G_RadiusDamage
	totally rewritten this routine. Features:
	- Only entities which can take damage where looked at
	- if the entity is a player, there must be a line of sight
	  to the feet, to the chest or to the head
	- if the entity is not a player, one of the 6 planes creating the 
	  bounding box must be in line of sight
	- if a player is ducked, the damage will only be 2/3 of the original damage
	Anyhow, this change needs a big test (don't want to have grenades with
	issues again)
* fixed several old flashbang bugs
	actually there was an anti-flashbang existing. anyhow, i rewrote the code as
	it was bugged. Features:
	- if you get hit by a flashbang you can just get a small flicker indicating
	  the FB hit you (far away) or full effect (close)
	- the annoying sound is only played if the player is at least for 10 msecs
	  100% blinded
	- if 100% blinded, no nonlocal sound is played
	- if a player gets hit by 2 flashbangs, only the bigger effect will count
* removed delayed leg damage from nsco/game/g_combat.c and nsco/game/g_seals.c
	function nsco/game/g_combat.c - G_Damage         patched
	function nsco/game/g_seals.c  - NS_CauseBleeding patched
	just had to remove the delayed leg damage and take the old code back in
	again. Seems to work, needs to be tested.
* removed the server death-spamming / several files in nsco/game/*
	while playing, the server could death-spam a client. This happend mostly
	when a player pressed the USE button and tried to defuse a bomb. the
	server didn't stop spamming the client with messages that the bomb is
	for the other team or the bomb cannot be defused.
	Changes:
	game/g_local.h: datastructure clientPersistant_t
		removed - teamVoteCount (was not used)
		added   - lmt (last message time)
	game/g_client.c: function ClientBegin
		added initialization code for client->pers.lmt
	game/g_cmds.c: function Cmd_CallTeamVote
		removed code related to teamVoteCount (was the only place)
	game/g_weapon.c: functions bomb_touch and bomb_use
		changed the PrintMsg code. a player gets a max of one PrintMsg from this
		functions in a second.
* XXX in nsco/game/g_local.h / clientPersistant_t
	the structure must not have bigger size (dunno why), resolved this
	with the help of Defcon-X. Anyhow, make another test when adding a
	variable at the beginning and one at the end!
* patched nsco/game/g_combat.c
	i created a headshot bug there (headshots where not possible any more).
	fixed that (had to out-comment the first if statement)
		

2004/01/07:
* added nsco/game/variables.h
	this file will from now on contain all important variable settings
	vor navy seals. changing a variable in this file will change them
	in the whole nsco code
* fixed flashbug in nsco/game/g_missile.c
	unlinked the assaultfield entities _BEFORE_ calculating a better position 
	for the flashbang to go off (it vanished in the floor before)
* removed unnecessary messages
	removed several unnecessary messages. the most important message removed
	was the 'WARNING: Wrong character cvar - default character used'. This 
	happens everytime a player joins a server and therefore does not have
	a character yet.
